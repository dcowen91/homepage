                    <p> I am a software engineer interested in all realms of development!</p>
                    <p>I study at the University of Arizona, seeking a degree in Computer Science. I will graduate in May 2014.</p>
                    <p>This is My "Home Page". As of now, there really isn't much to see. Don't assume that there isn't much to me though! More is to come to this venue.</p>
